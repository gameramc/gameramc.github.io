	<h1> EXPERIENCE AND REVIEW </h1>
	<h1> WARDEN </h1>
	<br>
	Starting with the most anticipated mob, we have the Warden. This boss mob was teased for the Minecraft 1.18 Caves &
	Cliffs update, but it couldn’t reach the game in time. With a whole ancient city structure to itself, the Warden
	only spawns underground in the deep dark caves biome. It’s also the first blind mob in the game. Since it can’t see
	you, the Warden relies on sound and vibrations you make to find and hunt you.
	<br>
	As experienced in test versions of Minecraft, Warden can kill a player with just 2 hits even if they have a full
	netherite armor on. Even though most players are waiting for it, many won’t be delighted to encounter it in the
	game. And to make matters worse, Warden’s presence gives a darkness-based effect that limits our visibility.
	<br>

	<h1> FROG </h1>
	<br>
	As a part of the newly revamped swamps, frogs are a passive mob coming to Minecraft 1.19 in three variants.
	Depending upon their spawn location, the frog can have three variants – default, cold, or tropical. Just like real
	life, Minecraft frogs can jump really high, swim faster, and prey on smaller mobs.
	<br>
	You can find frogs sitting on the edges of lands as well as on lily pads and drip leaves within swamps and mangrove
	swamps. In terms of food, their meals are small magma cubes and small slime cubes. And if a frog eats a magma cube,
	it drops froglight, which is a colorful block that emits light. Meanwhile, slime cubes are the food that a player
	can use to make frogs mate.

	<h1> Tadpoles </h1>
	<br>
	Our next new mob in Minecraft 1.19 Wild Update is the baby version of frogs – tadpoles. They spawn from eggs that
	frogs release on top of the water surface. Usually found in groups, tadpoles are now the second smallest mob in
	Minecraft. You can even capture them in water buckets to move them. But unlike frogs, tadpoles can’t survive outside
	the water for long. They also have a very tiny health bar and can die in a single hit.
	<br>

	<h1> ALLAY </h1>
	<br>
	Our next new mob for Minecraft 1.19 is the Allay. This cute creature is the result of user choice mob votes held in
	2021. Players chose it over the baby golem, which players like myself still miss. Though, unlike most mobs in the
	game, the Allay’s function is mostly player-based. It picks up dropped items and collects copies of that item from
	the loaded chunks of your world.
	<br>
	At most, it can carry a full stack of items, which are usually 64 items. However, Allay isn’t allowed to steal items
	from players’ chests. Allay, at its movements might suggest, loves music. So, it drops its collected items only next
	to a note block or a player. We have a dedicated guide to help you understand everything you need to know about
	Allay in Minecraft. Also, if you wish to find the Allay ahead of its official release, we have a tutorial on how to
	get Allay in Minecraft beta.

	<h1> FIREFLYS </h1>
	<br>
	As you can guess, fireflies are the smallest mob in Minecraft 1.19. Contrary to earlier speculations, they don’t
	interact with the frogs. So, their presence seems more based on aesthetic purposes. You can find glowing fireflies
	only in the swamp biome, and that too, mostly at night time. Compared to other new mobs in Minecraft 1.19, fireflies
	aren’t the most popular addition. Nevertheless, their presence is going to make the in-game nights more lively.

	<h1> New Mobs That Will Be Added in Minecraft 1.19 </h1>
	<br>
	Whether it’s the deadly Warden or the friendly Allay, Minecraft 1.19 will have a lot to offer in terms of new mobs,
	and we’re all hyped for it. Moreover, since the update is months away from release, who knows how long our list of
	new mobs will become in a few months. So, don’t forget to check for more updates. Meanwhile, if you want to revamp
	your existing world, you can try the best Minecraft modpacks. Though, you need to install Forge in Minecraft to run
	them and other best mods in Minecraft. Additionally, a majority of the teased mob have some direct or indirect
	relation with lighting in the game. So, installing the best Minecraft 1.18 shaders might be a smart choice. With
	that said, which mob are you most interested in meeting in Minecraft 1.19 update? Tell us in the comments below.
